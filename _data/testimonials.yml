    I hired Paul as a Sales Engineer in my growing U.S. team and immediately saw the positive impact, not only in revenue but in sales team development and process improvement. Paul brings an impressive technical and personal level of commitment to teams he's on as well as other groups such as marketing, product, and executive leadership. He was instrumental in elevating our offering in DevOps and continuous delivery teams, writing many early code examples and modernizing our training resources. He also brought our product leaders on-site with some of our biggest customers who were primed to share their internal roadmaps and collaborate on the future of our product because of the trust he helped to develop with them. He even made internal business cases for technology integrations in high demand so that we could make well-timed investment decisions, ultimately leading to the creation of our 'customer engineering' role which is still critical to sales and customer success to this day. It was great to work with him for the years we did!

    When Paul pitched Incubation Engineering to me in 2021, it was an easy decision to bring him into my Product organization. He quickly became an invaluable resource -- not only for Quality Engineering and DevOps discussions and advanced demos, but also for his ability to collaborate with a small team to transform innovative ideas into prototypes. Some of these prototypes led to patent filings, while others evolved into approved new product initiatives.

    As I transitioned to lead the Office of Strategy, Paul was once again eager to contribute, this time tackling complex challenges in strategic positioning, competitive differentiation, and technical due diligence for potential acquisitions. He even played a key role in organizing internal hackathons, all while managing the work funnel for his incubation team. Paul was consistently prepared for our one-on-one meetings, bringing thoughtful insights and a clear sense of priorities for the week. His structured thinking and meticulous note-taking allowed us to cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time, which was invaluable given our limited resources.

    I frequently heard from his colleagues how much they benefited from his cross-functional discussions and his “Mug club” sessions, where people could pitch new ideas and receive feedback on early features. Paul's willingness to facilitate open collaboration helped foster a culture of innovation and continuous improvement within the team.

    Beyond his role in product and strategy, Paul has been highly active in the DevOps community. He has organized DevOps Days events, spoken at numerous industry conferences, authored insightful articles, and built tools to address critical challenges in the space.

    Paul consistently goes above and beyond in everything he does. His strong emotional intelligence allows him to connect with and motivate teams, particularly those that are newly formed. He has a unique ability to catalyze progress and bring out the best in everyone he works with. I have no doubt that Paul will continue to make significant contributions in any role he takes on.

    Paul and I had many discussions that directly impacted my PM decisions. I could always count on him to make time to listen, think, and constructively challenge new feature work I ran by him. He also hosted some great internal sessions for our team to experiment which led to fantastic ideas that customers were excited about. He is one of the most supportive colleagues I've ever had the pleasure of working with.

    Paul and I crushed it at Neotys for years. In the office, on the road, on every remote session we needed...he had my back. It didn't take long for us to win huge logos and close some of the biggest deals in the company's history. Hope to work with him again at some point!

    Paul was extremely helpful with positioning around DevOps and on webinars as a subject matter expertise. We worked closely on multiple projects and content pieces where his attention to detail and customer focus made them all the more powerful resources for our sales and marketing teams. Many of his visual contributions also made it into our core messaging and sales decks as well.

    Paul was instrumental in maturing our evangelism in the performance and dev ops community. He is a well respected technical mind in that arena. His commitment to improving sales execution as a sales engineer was key to our ability to win more deals. He pushed me as a leader to work with him to develop more advanced sales methodologies. Paul is never satisfied with the status quo.

    Paul is an enthusiastic learner and great cross-functional agent of support for fellow co-workers! Though we were on different teams, his weekly mugclub sessions were always an invaluable space to discuss, compare, and refine our sales approach. He’s the kind of person that quickly earns trust, across internal teams as well as externally with users and their leadership.

    In our corporate development overlap, Paul led the effort to provide highly credible pre-acquisition technical due diligence. I was always impressed with his ability to summarize actionable intel from deep-dives, sometimes even consolidating a huge amount of work into easy to understand decisions. He also grew trust between groups which is rare and necessary for long-term success.

    Between Smartbear and Neotys/Tricentis, I had the pleasure of working closely on a handful of very important customers. As Neotys worked to grow our Enterprise customer base, Paul was very integral in winning those customers confidence and ensuring their success. Paul is a very technical guy but knows how to read the room and follow-up well. This was never more apparent then when we worked with the more complicated integration demos and objection handling, this is something not every sales engineer can do well.

    Paul is the most talented and effective technologist and change agent I have ever known. Paul is innately curious with a voracious appetite for learning that is seemingly boundless. But Paul's true genius is his passion for teaching. Whether speaking at conferences, leading meet-ups, advising clients or just casual conversation with colleagues, Paul creates interactive learning environments where he thoughtfully and energetically enables fertile learning environments. As the Head of Marketing, I routinely relied upon Paul for product marketing insights and to work collaboratively in a wide variety of community and field marketing events. In addition to being an amazing technologist and teacher, Paul is also one of the finest humans I know. People naturally want to follow Paul because of his brilliance, but also because his sincerity and empathy is so genuine. I would jump at the opportunity to work with Paul again in a heartbeat!

    Paul is a friendly, approachable technical expert. He helped our sales org become audible-ready in front of new types of enterprise customer profiles and even supported new hires with one-on-ones. His training helped us improve our discovery process, seek stronger champions, and increase stickiness in accounts. 

    His ability to represent stages of the software lifecycle in a way we could all draw on a whiteboard further helped us to run discovery sessions and find specific challenges my sales team could address. Paul's visualizations regularly found their way into customer-facing decks and materials because they connect my team to developers in a way we all can discuss and reason about, an invaluable aspect of effective selling.

    Paul worked as a Developer Evangelist in my Product Marketing team at Perfecto. He is passionate and hard working. His combination of technical expertise, business acumen, and creative thinking makes him a strong asset to any team. 

    In 2016, we launched several developer-focused platform capabilities. Paul passionately drove key aspects of our sales enablement and go-to-market strategy, including internal training sessions, supporting materials aligned to our core messaging and sales methodologies, and public relations engagements. I would frequently rely on his perspective when it came to communicating complex ideas through easy to understand visuals. His is free hand line art skills were a definite bonus.

    He also played an important role in crafting our story for enterprises moving towards scaled Agile and DevOps cultures, many of his ideas making into customer-facing materials and presentations. 
    Paul's own presentations at conferences elevated our brand through carefully crafted combination of thought leadership, process-related insights and technical demonstrations. He’s committed to delivering value to his audience.
    
    His research often resulted in output that easily supported our content marketing strategy, but also helped to direct future product positioning. 

    He is coachable, adaptable and has an insatiable appetite for learning.

    Paul supported my marketing objectives at Perfecto, helping to construct and fulfill our content strategy towards developers. He wrote for our blog, delivered research reports and drove webinars that supported our lead gen goals, drove influencer programs, and generally helped out wherever we needed subject matter expertise. 

    Paul often pushed our definition of done to a new level, using his technical skills in process automation to improve our internal communications. He helped to integrate systems like Slack into our workflows to notify various team members of relevant real-time information related to event sponsorship and speaking opportunities. 

    Paul also managed projects that required alignment across multiple stakeholders, not an easy thing to do. He learns quickly and adapts to the culture of a team to get things done.

    I’ve worked with Paul for his whole tenure with SmartBear, either as a fellow sales engineer or in the same department with API line of products. 

    Paul started at SmartBear as a really passionate sales engineer for performance products. He quickly became an expert in load and performance testing and worked tirelessly in demoing and promoting products alongside with the account reps. 
    
    In his later role at SmartBear as API team Product Marketing Manager Paul went above and beyond producing volumes of internal and customer facing content of the highest quality. He would frequently distill really technical features to simplest easy-to-understand explanations. Paul always stayed really active in the API community and proactively worked with every department in SmartBear to greatly improve products. 
    
    Paul is one of the most dedicated people I have worked with. He really takes pride and ownership over everything he produces. He’s also really creative and his unique approach to technical challenges produces some groundbreaking ideas. He’ll be missed here at SmartBear
