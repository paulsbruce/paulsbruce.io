# Community Organizing

I love and appreciate learning. This happens in so many ways, but especially surrounded
 by others to do so too. This is why spending extra time outside work, volunteering
 for organizing and contributing to various communities, is so important to me.

I currently:

* Co-organize [DevOpsDays Boston](https://devopsdays.org/events/2022-boston/welcome/)
* Chair [o11yfest](https://o11yfest.org/)
* Co-organize the [Boston DevOps meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Devops/) and their Community Slack
* Act as the President and Chair of the [Boston DevOps Network](https://bostondevopsnetwork.org/), the NPO underwriter of DevOpsDays Boston
* Chaired [DevSecOps Days Boston 2021](https://devsecopsdaysboston.org/)
* Occasionally help with OTel Comms SIG

If you're interested in getting involved in any of the above, [contact me](/contact)!

# Volunteering

There are also a few things I get involved in because either I have some useful skills
 or guidance to provide, such as:

- local D&D and robotics clubs for kids
- running "Digital Safety 101" workshops at the Senior Citizen's Center and VA
- maintaining a local park, fixing swings, mowing the grass, planting trees

# Consulting

Every so often, I come across something so juicy and worthwhile investment outside
 of all the other asks for my time. Again, usually the motivation is learning and
 exercising technical muscles that aren't in the wheelhouse of my professional career.

I don't take too many of these on because, under contract, it means I have to prioritize
 this over all other non-full-time things I'm doing. I also don't have a backup person
 for this type of work, though it could easily be transferred to someone in my network
 if a catastrophic situation or life event gets in the way of delivering.
