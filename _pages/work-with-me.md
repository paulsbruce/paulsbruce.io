# Areas of Work

I work on multiple fronts:

* Professional / Full-time
* Community Organizing
* Volunteering
* Consulting

# Professional / Full-time

I currently work at Tricentis as the Head of Incubation Engineering (IncEng). IncEng
 is a critical function of business and you can think of it like an internal startup
 incubator or accelerator. My team:

* encourages innovation across the organization in product/service like outcomes
* vets internal projects for business value and payoff likelihoods
* provides business and engineering hours towards accepted ideas to guide them into successful graduates
* facilitates internal gatherings such as weekly "Mug Clubs", monthly showcases, and quarterly awards events
* continuously improves the above work motions, our own selves, and each other

I'm ALWAYS hiring, even if I'm not. Between my professional team, other teams inside
 my organization, and even from my volunteer organizing work, I can probably help
 you move in the direction you're looking to go in your career. Maybe we can help each other too.

CURRENT OPEN OPPORTUNITIES:

# Community Organizing

I love and appreciate learning. This happens in so many ways, but especially surrounded
 by others to do so too. This is why spending extra time outside work, volunteering
 for organizing and contributing to various communities, is so important to me.

I currently:

* Co-organize [DevOpsDays Boston](https://devopsdays.org/events/2022-boston/welcome/)
* Chair [o11yfest](https://o11yfest.org/)
* Co-organize the [Boston DevOps meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Devops/) and their Community Slack
* Act as the President and Chair of the [Boston DevOps Network](https://bostondevopsnetwork.org/), the NPO underwriter of DevOpsDays Boston
* Chaired [DevSecOps Days Boston 2021](https://devsecopsdaysboston.org/)
* Occasionally help with OTel Comms SIG

If you're interested in getting involved in any of the above, [contact me](/contact)!

# Volunteering

There are also a few things I get involved in because either I have some useful skills
 or guidance to provide, such as:

- local D&D and robotics clubs for kids
- running "Digital Safety 101" workshops at the Senior Citizen's Center and VA
- maintaining a local park, fixing swings, mowing the grass, planting trees

# Consulting

Every so often, I come across something so juicy and worthwhile investment outside
 of all the other asks for my time. Again, usually the motivation is learning and
 exercising technical muscles that aren't in the wheelhouse of my professional career.

I don't take too many of these on because, under contract, it means I have to prioritize
 this over all other non-full-time things I'm doing. I also don't have a backup person
 for this type of work, though it could easily be transferred to someone in my network
 if a catastrophic situation or life event gets in the way of delivering.
