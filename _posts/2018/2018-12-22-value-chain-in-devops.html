<h2>What is a 'value chain'?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A <strong>value chain</strong> is a set of activities that a firm operating in a specific industry performs in order to deliver a valuable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)">product</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics)">service</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)">market</a>. The concept comes through business management and was first described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter">Michael Porter</a> in his 1985 publication, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_Advantage">Competitive Advantage</a>: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance</em>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain#cite_note-Porter1996-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The idea of the value chain is based on the process view of organizations, the idea of seeing <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="6" data-gr-id="6">a manufacturing</g> (or service) organization as a system, made up of subsystems each with inputs, transformation processes <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">and</g> outputs. Inputs, transformation processes, and outputs involve the acquisition and consumption of resources – money, labor, materials, equipment, buildings, land, administration and management. How value chain activities are carried out determines costs and affects profits.— IfM, Cambridge<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain#cite_note-IfM-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2>How does it related to IEEE 2675?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As related to DevOps, the Value Chain for Software Delivery is an application of a lifecycle perspective that scopes standards adherence to only certain individuals based on their participation in primary or supporting activities related to a particular software product.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>DevOps is about continuously delivering value to users/customers/consumers. A value chain perspective disaggregates activities from an organizational funnel, making it easier for teams and consumers of a particular product or service to ask "does this thing meet the standard" without unintentionally including other unrelated teams or products, were the question be phrased as "does this organization meet the standard".</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>What problem are we solving by using 'value chain'?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Adoption. In large organizations with many independent groups or product teams, DevOps principals may apply across the value chain of one product, but not another, provided these products are completely independent <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6">from</g> one another. For an organization or team to claim that a particular software product adheres to this standard, all aspects of that product’s value chain must implement the principals and practices set forth in this standard.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Examples of where the broadness of using “organization” presents a challenge to adoption:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Consulting agencies with many independent project teams on working on separate contracts/products
<ul>
<li>If only one of those contacts require adherence to 2675, does this require every team/contract (both in the future and retroactively) to do the same?</li>
<li>Using “value chain” would scope 2675 adherence to any and all parties performing activities germane to delivering that specific contract/product</li>
<li>We know that if even one team implements DevOps per 2675 and sees success, organizations are likely to grow that out to other teams over time; “value chain” helps adoption of the standard.&nbsp;
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enterprises in the midst of transformation to DevOps
<ul>
<li>Can they claim adherence on a specific product if the “whole organization” can’t yet?</li>
<li>Much like the above agencies argument, when the scope of adherence is based on activities relating to delivery of a project, enterprises are far more capable of becoming “DevOps ready” because they can grow the practice out *over time*</li>
<li>In DevOps, key success factors are determined – driven – by customers, the end user.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organization’s requirements from non-technical internal agencies
<ul>
<li>Can we expect that the legal or HR departments are also “DevOps”?&nbsp;<br />This would of course need to be defined by activities that support the delivery side of the business (i.e. billing, purchasing, etc.), begetting an activities-based perspective on implementation over organizational labeling</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is this of importance to IEEE 2675?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In layman's terms, adoption of IEEE 2675 at an organizational level can't happen overnight, especially in large enterprises with many teams. Fortunately, it doesn't have to, provided we adequately scope 'shall' statements with a perspective that A) is reasonable in scope and impact on the org, and B) enables parties to agree on what it means for a software product to have been developed and delivered using this standard.</p>

<h2>How and where would we use 'value chain'?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Places in the text where use of the word 'organization' could infer that IEEE 2675 must be implemented across the whole organization before any single team or product could claim adherence to the standard.&nbsp;For instance:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Too broad:</p>
<p>"Organizations shall implement effective continuous delivery procedures aligned with the architecture definition in a manner that meets the business needs of the system." ...&nbsp;"DevOps itself requires effective architecture across the organization to ensure that application build, package and deployment procedures are implemented in a robust and consistent manner." (6.4.4)</p>
</li>
<li>Scoped:&nbsp;
<p>"Organizations shall implement effective continuous delivery procedures&nbsp;within a particular value chain that are&nbsp;aligned with the architecture definition&nbsp;and&nbsp;in a manner that meets the business needs of the system." ...&nbsp;"DevOps itself requires effective architecture across&nbsp;the whole value chain&nbsp;to ensure that application build, package and deployment procedures are implemented in a robust and consistent manner."</p>
</li>
<li>Too broad:&nbsp;
<p>"Organizations shall maintain an accurate record of both code deployed and fully automated mechanisms in order to remove obsolete code."</p>
