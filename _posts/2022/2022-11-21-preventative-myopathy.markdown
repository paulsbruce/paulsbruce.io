# TL;DR What I do to maintain professional vs. personal live balance

* Find a way to take a 'YouCon' (personal off-time at least once a year)
* Make hours your own
* Have your own defensible workload strategy, don't just accept others'

People don't RTFM (Read the Fucking Manual). They barely read emails they're directly
 addressed on. The only time documentation is sought out is when something isn't
 intuitive to you, within the context of your work.
