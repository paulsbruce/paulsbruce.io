![Founding Takes Finding](/assets/images/2024/2024-09-11-founding-takes-finding.jpg)

In my recent transition to becoming a *founder of a startup* (at least part time until bootstraps kick in), I've started to immerse myself in topics already known about but not thoroughly understood. Building an advisory board, funding and investor relations, grant and subsidies targeting, short and long range planning, 'thesis' and focus/scope crafting, true field research (i.e. farm work and owner discussions)...it's a lot all at once but all necessary to evolve together at the same time.

**My Board of Advisors**

At this point, I have nine people I regularly meet with to discuss aspects of the startup. All are folks I've worked with in some capacity before and formed meaningful trust and respect with. Intentionally built in to this group is diversity in perspectives, vocations, experiences, and personalities so that we have the best chance of exploring and incrementally improving our motions together. These folks include professionals from:

* software and product development
* sales and marketing
* finance and investments
* different cultures and nations

They are purposely not 'Field Advisors' (i.e. for FarmTech, this means actual farmers) because the two groups often have very different methods of collaborative exchange and conversational flow, not to mention schedules. One of the key characteristics I'm responsible for at this point is 'bridging' (re: Westrum organizational typology), connecting individuals from these groups in very dialogs about very specific topics together, but I still need to figure out effective coordinations between them. In the meantime, one-on-ones and otherwise very small group combinations gets me the context, explorations, further buy-in I need from others.

Whether a board or field advisor, it is critical to utilize the earned trust appropriately, and certainly for 'referrals'. This also applies to most people I encounter but to varying degrees because when you are 'founding', you are constantly on the search to *find*...more and useful. My particular entrepreneurial spirit is more about entrepre-NEW than it is about entrepren-OLD, be it ideas or context or people connections or whatever, but both are valid assets for investment. I'm just always in discovery mode to some degree or another.

**Funding and Investor Relations**

As most first-time founders find out quickly, we don't know what we don't know. This is why I have dove in head first to startup books, conferences, podcasts, networking events, on the particular the topic of funding sources. So far, I've found that these can include:

* Bootstrap sources (personal or close-connections funds)
* Crowdsourced funds (i.e. kickstarter, gofundme, etc.)
* Loans from a financial institution (i.e. personal asks into a bank)
* Grants from governing bodies (e.g. states, federal, city)
* Grants from regulatory entities (e.g. USDA, FDA, EPA)
* Grants from educational/academic entities (i.e. colleges)
* Grants from private organizations (i.e. charities or networks thereof)
* Private donors (not intentionally angel investors, more like personal/close connections)
* Angel investors (intentionally investing via directed portfolio)
* Venture capital investors (for-profit, usually 10x expectations)

After a recent presentation from David Chang which plots these funding sources against two axes, ranges of funding and expectations on funds provided, I believe I have to bootstrap a bit first and mix that with some crowdfunding efforts as well before I want to accept larger funds from other sources. The preference on those later other sources would be small grants, then private and angel investors, then possibly additional larger grants, and only then VC investment if at all. Grants can be useful, but often come with lots of paperwork, are only temporary infusions of cash, and can't be relied upon for too long without undermining the need to prove future solvency.


My Experimentation Pool

* BNI
* Boston Startup Week


I've realized that it's important to draw a distinction between passive and active modes of operation such as:

* looking vs. searching/seeking
* observing vs. experimenting
* fulfilling vs. fulfillment
* puzzling vs. solving
* organizing vs. directing

In particular, 
* finding vs. founding
