<p>This week, I realized that for years, I've been looking at life changes in terms of cost. How much will it cost to move, how much will it cost if I quit, how much will it cost if I fail.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing of worth comes on a silver spoon</strong></p>
<p>Despite warnings and signs, friends and teachers, and despite being part of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/07/my-one-piece-of-advice-to-next-generation-of-api-evangelists-is-to-take-care-of-yourself/" target="_blank">moments in spacetime</a> I would gladly revisit, my aha moments always necessarily originate internally, most often when I put myself in challenging situations. I always want to know what's in the pita.</p>
<p>While waiting for an officer to write me a bogus citation today, it hit me that much as in the same way I measure things from both sunk vs. opportunity cost perspectives in business, I forgot to do that with my home and personal life. The cost of what I'm doing in one place is more than what it costs me emotionally, physically, and mentally; it's costing me true happiness that I'm leaving on the table.</p>
<p><strong>Forget silver, there is no spoon</strong></p>
<p>I love this thing. It's not my family (of course I love them), it's literally a thing. I have fallen in love with an open source thing. That passion has caused me to ignore the bigger picture. And who the fuck loves a thing over themselves?</p>
<p>When someone or something is tied to a prior transformation, it's hard to give it up. It's an edifice, a token. It's also just a thing. And since this particular thing is open source, it's free (for now at least) so at least there's no sunk cost for me to keep using it.</p>
<p><strong>There may be no spoon, how about a knife</strong></p>
<p>I feel like a snake during ecdysis, or maybe a pile of phoenix ash. Either way, change is coming, and bitches, watch what happens between here and <a href="http://gluecon.com/" target="_blank">Denver</a>. I have something no one is expecting. I will cut through so much wrapping paper that the present inside will be a fun little aftershow.</p>
