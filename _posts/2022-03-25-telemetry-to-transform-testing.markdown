# Session Title

Transform Your Continuous Testing with (Open)Telemetry

# Session Description

Except for instrumented unit testing, it's often really hard to know what's exactly
 what's going wrong when your tests fail, especially when our systems
 are now highly distributed and involved multiple APIs, micro-frontends, and 3rd-party
 services. Versioning across these dependencies and complex rollout processes also
 further obfuscate what the heck is really going wrong when your tests fail.

Enter "telemetry", and specifically OpenTelemetry. Technology that emits contextual
 and timeseries-ready data about what's going on dramatically improve everyone's
 ability to isolate, diagnose, and resolve issues quickly.

BOTH systems AND tests that share modern, distributed context such as OpenTelemetry
 span and baggage details transform testing into more precise and actionable feedback.
Come learn about how to inject context back into your work in this session.

# Three Key Takeaways

* How additional context dramatically improves actionable outcomes of testing
* How OpenTelementry applies to both software systems AND testing processes
* How to get started using OpenTelemetry in your code bases
