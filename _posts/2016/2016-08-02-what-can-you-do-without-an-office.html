Make one yourself! Tag #SummerOfSelenium[/caption]</p>
<p>I rarely go to the beach. When I do, I like to do what I like to do: surprise, tech stuff. We all relax in different ways, no judgement here. We also all need to work flexibly, so I'm also busy with a new co-working space for my locals.</p>
<p>In back and forth with a <a href="https://twitter.com/ek121268" target="_blank">colleague</a> of mine, we started to talk about <em>strange places where we find ourselves writing Selenium scripts</em>. All sorts of weird things have been happening in mobile this summer, <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/pokenomics-explaining-success-pokemon-go-phenomenon-financial-nintendo-484951" target="_blank">Pokemon Go</a> (which I call pokenomics) for example, and Eran was busy creating a cross-platform test script for his <a href="http://bit.ly/2aFRZwi" target="_blank">upcoming webinar</a> that tests their download and installation process.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6471;">At work, we're doing this <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SummerOfSelenium" target="_blank">#SummerOfSelenium</a> thing, and I thought that it would be cool to start a meme competition themed around summer-time automated testing from strange places. Fun times, or at least a distraction from the <em>7th circle of XPath hell</em> that we're still regularly subjected to via test frameworks.</span></p>
<p>If you want to build your own meme, use the following links...</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/paulsbruce/status/760484806274719744" target="_blank">Reply to my tweet</a> with your image and I'll figure out a way to get our marketing team to send you some schwag. ;D</p>
<p>Mine was:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulsbruce.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/17zb39.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-363" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2016/08/17zb39.jpg" alt="17zb39" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>Then Eran responded with:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulsbruce.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Capture.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-364" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2016/08/Capture.png" alt="Capture" width="837" height="422" /></a></p>
<p>We think we're funny at least.</p>
<hr />
<p>Side-note: co-working spaces are really important. As higher-paid urban jobs overtake local employment in technical careers, we need to respond to the demand for work-life balance and encourage businesses to do the same. Co-working spaces create economic stickiness and foster creativity through social engagement. My thoughts + a local survey are <a href="http://bit.ly/2aivGKq" target="_blank">here</a>, in case you want to learn more. A research area of mine and one I'll be speaking on in the next year.</p>
