<p>Just came across this nugget after Googling for 30 seconds.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intrications/intent-intercept">https://github.com/intrications/intent-intercept</a></p>
<p>Essentially, you can mine an app for the intents it signals to the outside world, then intercept, then re-inject them with your own modified data. Does this seem like a potential app vulnerability to you?</p>
<p>More research must be done, but this smells like something I want to bring up in my Edges of Espresso talk at AnDevCon SF this month.</p>

<p>Found this, old, but good article supporting my concerns. <a title="Intentional Evil: A Pen Tester's Overview of Android Intents" href="https://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2013/05/02/intentional-evil-an-pen-testers-overview-of-android-intents#">Intentional Evil: A Pen Tester's Overview of Android Intents</p>
<p></a>Also, I keep re-reading this one on IntentTestRule usage because it's so how my brain works. <a href="http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/04/28/testing-intents-on-android-like-stabbing-yourself-in-the-eye-with-a-blunt-implement/" target="_blank">http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2016/04/28/testing-intents-on-android-like-stabbing-yourself-in-the-eye-with-a-blunt-implement/</a></p>
