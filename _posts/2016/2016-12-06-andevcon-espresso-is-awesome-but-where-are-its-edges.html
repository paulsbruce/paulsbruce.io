<p>For my presentation at AnDevCon SF 2016, I focused on how Espresso represents a fundamentalÂ change in how approach the process of shipping software that provably works on a mobile ecosystem that is constantly changing.</p>
<p>The feedback was overwhelmingly good, many people who stopped by the Perfecto booth before or after our talk came to me to discuss topics I raised. In other words, it did what I wanted, which was to provide value and strike up conversation about how to improve the Android UI testing process.</p>
<p>If you're pressed for time, my slides can be found below or at:<br />
