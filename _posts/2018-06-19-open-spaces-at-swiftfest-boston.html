<p>I'll be hosting an open spaces "in the wild" session at Banyan Bar from 6pm-9pm at the end of Swiftfest Boston Tuesday June 19th 2018. Look for me and for people with party beads like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://paulsbruce.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/20180619_114426-e1529423410658.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1086 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2018/06/20180619_114426-e1529423616508-1024x600.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="308" /></a></p>
<h3>Location and Timing</p>
<p>We will be meeting at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Banyan+Bar+%2B+Refuge/@42.3444073,-71.0741537,17z">Banyan Bar</a> right around the corner from the conference. <strong>Feel free to walk over after the conference ends at 6pm, the conversation will start at 7pm,</strong> and I'll be handing out free drink tickets at around 8pm after we are done.</h3>
<h3>What is open spaces?</h3>
<p>Open Spaces is an "unconferencey" way to have small group conversations on topics that are most relevant to our community at just the right time. You submit topics (<a class="link" title="http://bit.ly/openswift2018" href="http://bit.ly/openswift2018" target="__blank">http://bit.ly/openswift2018</a>) that you want to discuss in a group setting, then before the event, these topics are grouped into categories that help people self-organize into right-fit groups.</p>
<p>What Will We Discuss?</p>
<p>Because this open spaces event is the last workshop session of SwiftFest Boston 2018 (<a class="link" title="http://swiftfest.io/" href="http://swiftfest.io/" target="__blank">http://swiftfest.io/</a>), it's likely that topics will gravitate towards technically-focused iOS development, testing, and operations, and team management. Great for conference attendees, great for Mobile Tea members too!</p>
<p>However, a key affinity of the open spaces approach is to let the community figure out what matters most right now, and there’s a lot going on in the broader tech scene in Boston today, like DevOps leadership, sustainable startup practices, effective technical recruitment, municipal transportation and infrastructure support, etc. You never know, and that’s the fun part!</p>
