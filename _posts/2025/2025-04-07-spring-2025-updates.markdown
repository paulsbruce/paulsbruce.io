# Context

Over the past year, I've been searching for the right career 'next move' options. Primarily, this has been to find a new corporate Sales Engineering job, but after over 300+ job applications, about 6 serious interviews, and numerous personal referrals that all ended up leaving me with no good opportunities, I've decided to pivot my efforts to what pays the bills and doesn't drive me nuts.

# Updated Goal: Be Diverse, Like Healthy Soil

TL;DR - I'm pivoting towards a multi-modal system of income sources starting with tech consulting and farming. That includes technical advising startups, hands-on cloud and DevOps work, and...farm work!

# (Only) One Terrible Year for Tech?

# (Only) One Terrible Year for Farms?

TL;DR - Despite agricultural SMBs facing increasing challenges, I'd rather pour a calculated amount of my support into local and long-term opportunities rather than ignore my conscience.

# Dual-stack Career: Farm Operations Intern and Technical Advisor

TL;DR - I'm going to make at least enough to survive via technical consulting, but also double-down on the value of my other/farm work to support the long-term goals of a meaningful agricultural startup.
