As part of my usual duties, Tricentis asked me to name a few key themes and trends
 that I've seen during customer engineering work with forward-thinking customers,
 ones that will likely be a big part of performance engineering in 2022.

There is no predicting the future, there's only keeping your eyes and ears open
 and developing intuition, then collecting evidence for AND against hypotheses.
